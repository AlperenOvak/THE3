This is third "take home exam" (THE) in 2022-2023 academic year.

## What is our task?
Your task in this assignment is to search for a 2-dimensional (2D) pattern P in a 2D image I.
A 2D pattern1 P with size N × M is a matrix with N rows and M columns such that P[i, j]
denotes the pixel value at i
th row and j
th column. Similarly, an image I is a matrix with H rows
and W columns such that I[i, j] denotes the pixel value at i
th row and j
th column. It is assumed
that patterns are always smaller than images; i.e., N < H and M < W.
